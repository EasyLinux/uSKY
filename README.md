# uSKY -- the world's smallest and lightest (0.4g) Frsky compatible RC receiver

This is for educational use only, bad things could happen if you run this on a real vehicle. 
Its meant to be used on indoor and/or small vehicles.

see http://fishpepper.de/projects/uSKY for more info

This hardware design uses some very bad hacks to archive the small package size,
i would not recommend this to be used for a production run! Stick to the Application Notes from TI
if you want to build a commercial device based on this. This layout will probably not pass anc compliance
testing and depending on transmission laws in your country it is probably not allowed to be operated without further testing.

Feel free to use the design - but make sure to give proper credit and
